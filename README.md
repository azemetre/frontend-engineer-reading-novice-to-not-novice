# Web Development: Novice to not Novice

### Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to provide a list of reading material, tutorials, lectures and other references for people who are new to Frontend Development and React.

In time, this repo will become a collection of links for future Employees to peruse in order to understand what we are trying to achieve, why we are doing it this way, what the downsides are, and how to contribute in a meaningful way quickly and efficiently.

### Origins

While at work, an intern they did not understand how React worked. They didn't understand the difference between the lifecycles events. They didn't understand the purpose of any of the tooling descisions. They didn't understand how alignment in CSS works. They didn't understand the difference between unit, integration, or functional tests. They didn't understand why some tests weren't testing implementation details. They didn't understand our git flow, or why we were using version control. They didn't understand why their PRs were rejected for accessbility. There wasn't much they understood.

There was nothing wrong with this.

We were all inexperienced at one point and we all learn at our own pace.

But it's hard to ask questions when you don't know what questions to ask. It's hard to seek out answers when you don't know the vocabular being used. It's how to understand what your coworkers are contributing when you don't have the same foundation of knowledge

In order to know what questions we should ask, we need to establish a foundation of knowledge.

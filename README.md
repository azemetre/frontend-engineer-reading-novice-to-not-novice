# React Reading: Novice to not Novice

The purpose of this is to provide a list of reading material for people who are new to React and Frontend Development.

While at work, an intern mentioned in passing that they don't understand how React works, they don't understand the difference between the lifecycles events, they don't understand how any of the tooling we use works, they didn't understand much of anything honestly.

But there is nothing wrong with this. We were all new at one point and it's hard to ask questions when you don't know what questions to ask. In order to know what questions to ask there needs to be a base level of foundational knowledge for any team to effectively communicate

The goal of this repo is to collect a series of links for future Employees to peruse in order to understand what we are trying to achieve, why we are doing it this way, what the downsides are, and how to contribute in a meaningful way quickly and efficiently.

Future goals will include condensing certain articles down for easier understanding (turning the technical details to conceptual details).
